<!-- <li><a href="/attaches/research_topics/sgm_graphene.html">Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) theory in Graphene</a>, (2022)</li> -->
<p>I am have an interest in a deeper understanding of wavefunctions in graphene. The wavefunction is one of the most crucial fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, which rich physical implications have been extensively debated in the areas of quantum chaos and quantum transport. Graphene has been a focus of experimental and theoretical physics for almost two decades, due to its high mobility at room temperature and the fact that its low-energy quasiparticles can be described by the massless Dirac equation. Consequently, it is important to detect and study the wavefunction properties in graphene. I prefer to do theoretical and numerical analysis that is closely related to experiments, and primarily examine scanning gate microscopy (SGM), magnetic transport, and many-body spectral statistics related to the wavefunction in graphene.</p>



    <article><h3 id="Wavefunction&QT"><a href="#Wavefunction&QT" class="headerlink" title="Wavefunction&QT"></a><font color=#2874A6>Wavefunction-related Quantum Transport in Graphene</font></h3>

       <p>The state of a microscopic particle in quantum mechanics can be represented by a wavefunction, and the square of its amplitude represents the probability of finding a particle at that location. For open quantum systems, the probability density of particles present in a small region can be calculated by the wave function to obtain the local density of states (LDOS) of particles. As an important physical quantity describing the behavior of electrons in graphene, the wavefunction has significant implications for understanding the differences between relativistic Dirac fermions in graphene and the behavior of two-dimensional electron gases described by the Schr√∂dinger equation in traditional systems. The focus of this research project is primarily twofold: firstly, the detection of LDOS in graphene, and secondly, the impact of LDOS on the magnetic transport of graphene quantum dots.</p>

1.       Theoretical and Numerical Study of Scanning Gate Microscopy in Graphene

       The SGM technique is a common way of observing LDOS in transport devices and has been widely applied in graphene-related research in recent years. Although some numerical studies have been conducted on related issues, it is highly important to develop a theoretical method that can respond to the diversity of parameters and geometric features that may be encountered in experiments when utilizing SGM. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of SGM tip-induced potentials on graphene nanoribbons with and without additional shape constraints. Specifically, we extended the perturbation theory, which is effective for non-invasive tips, to the case of graphene and derived the low-order conductance correction under weak tip intensity. Furthermore, we numerically validated the theory using a tight-binding model and studied the mechanism of invasive probes. This project was completed in collaboration with G. Weick, D. Weinmann, and R. Jalabert, during my two-year study trip to Strasbourg, France in pursuit of my doctoral degree. Further details about this work can be found in Phys. Rev. B 107, 085420 (2023). 

2.       Transport signatures of scarring states in graphene dots at low magnetic field

      Relativistic quantum scar can be observed in graphene systems, but the study of relativistic quantum magnetic scar is still an open problem. Therefore, exploring the magnetic scar states and their transport characteristics in graphene is valuable. In this study, we investigated the transport characteristics of graphene quantum dots under small magnetic fields. We explore two types of contour lines in the conductance maps of graphene quantum dots with respect to the Fermi energy and magnetic field distribution, which are related to their geometrical shapes. Combining semiclassical theory, we provided the conditions for the appearance of the two types of conductance contour lines and numerically verified them. We found that the conductance contour lines and the LDOS on them remain stable to some extent in the presence of impurities. Moreover, experimental data supported the results related to the conductance contour lines. This work was completed under the guidance of Prof. Liang Huang, my doctoral supervisor at Lanzhou University, and the relevant work is currently being prepared for submission. The experimental work was completed in collaboration with Prof. Hongqi Xu's group at Peking University, and the relevant work was published in Phys. Rev. B 101, 085404 (2020).


Many-body spectral statistics of graphene billiards

       Most studies in the field of quantum chaos are focused on single-particle non-relativistic systems, making the investigation of the relationship between many-body interactions, relativistic quantum mechanics, and classical dynamics highly valuable. Therefore, we will study the behavior of wavefunctions and the corresponding energy spectra in graphene billiards considering many-body interactions in the mean-field approximation.

Current work:

       For this topic, we studied the many-body spectral statistics of different circular sector graphene billiards. We found that electron-electron interactions have a significant effect on the energy spectral statistics near the Dirac point. In particular, raising the interaction intensity to a critical value result in a system close to Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (complete chaotic systems), regardless of the type of energy spectral statistics of the system without interaction. However, when the interaction increases above the critical value, the energy spectral statistic trends to the Poisson statistic (integrable system). In addition, we found that energy levels above and below the Dirac point can exhibit different spectral statistics, while many-body interactions have little effect on energy levels far from the Dirac point. This work was completed under the guidance of Prof. Liang Huang and related results have been published in Phys. Rev. Research 5, 013050 (2023).
